# WGCNA-benchmarking
Benchmarking WGCNA parameter combinations (correlation functions, network types, soft-threshold powers) to evaluate network and module structures and hub-gene stability. The goal is to choose parameter combinations that produce networks with good scale-free topology and biologically reliable modules, and to compare modules across all methods.
